# ðŸš€ ReactJS Learning Repository

This repository contains my notes and example code while learning **ReactJS**.  
The project is initialized with **Create React App (CRA)** for easy setup and running examples.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of ReactJS
- Practice with **Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`, ...)
- Learn about **Component patterns** (HOC, Render Props, Context API)
- Build small examples for each concept
- Manage code examples with Git instead of mixing them into notes
